- You will see some error code, that's because you must `import` some code before you can continue.
- if the error has gone, you must add this in your `androidManifest.xml`

if this is your first activity, than use this code

```
<manifest ...>
    <application ...>
        
        <activity android:name="{name of your activity}">
            <intent-filter>
                <action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN" />

                <category android:name="android.intent.category.LAUNCHER" />
            </intent-filter>
        </activity>
        
    </application>
</manifest>
```

but if there is another activity existed use this code

```
<manifest ...>
    <application ...>
        
        <activity android:name="{name of your activity}"></activity>
